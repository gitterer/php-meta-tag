# My Meta Tag Project

This project is essentially to allow meta tag to added to images.

## Why?

This was an exercise on file structute using parse functionlity and extracting data segment from an image that allows the stream process
to be processed .


## Usage

Here is a simple usage of the function.

Just subsititute the string for the directory you want analysed and add the meta tags 
```bash
$file = ""; // the directory to file

$meta = bin2hex("Meta data"); // meta data
```
output will write the current file in open stream
